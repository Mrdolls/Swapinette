# Swapinette
**Swapinette** is an interactive script to test your [`push_swap`](https://github.com/) project from 42 School.  
It provides two modes:
- **Evaluation Mode** – Automated tests with scoring based on 42's guidelines.
- **Custom Performance Test** – Custom input testing in an interactive loop.

## 🚀 Quick Installation
This will download and run the tester directly from GitHub — no need to clone anything manually.
```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mrdolls/swapinette/refs/heads/main/install.sh)"
```

## 💡 Smart Detection

✅ No need to download any checker!
The required binaries (checker_linux / checker_Mac) are bundled inside the script's checker_os/ folder and selected automatically based on your OS.
You can launch the script from any subfolder of your project — it will automatically locate push_swap and use the correct built-in checker.
